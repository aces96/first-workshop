 **pwd command**
pwd command, short for print working directory, will help you to find out the absolute path of the current directory.

**cd command**
 short for change directory. This command will help you to change your current
directory.

**ls command**
We use ls command to list the files and directories inside any given directory.
 1.  ls -l (-l is character not one) shows file or directory, size, modified date and time, file or folder name and owner of file and its permission.
 2. ls -a List all files including hidden file starting with ‘.‘.
 3. ls -lh  shows sizes in human readable format.
 4. ls -F will add the ‘/’ Character at the end each directory.
 5. ls -r option display files and directories in reverse order.
 6. ls -R option will list very long listing directory trees. 
 8. ls -ltr  will shows latest modification file or directory date as last. 
 
 **mkdir command**
 We can create new directories using mkdir command.
 We can also create nested directories in a single command using the -p option

 **rm command**
 rm command is used to remove a file, or directory. The -r option is being used to remove in a recursive way. With -f
you force the removal, ignoring errors and never prompt. You can chain the flags, so instead of rm -r -f you can as
well type rm -rf. But, always double check before you use rm -rf command, if you by mistake give this command in
your home directory, or any other important directory, it will not ask to confirm, but it will delete everything there. So,
please be careful and read twice before pressing enter key.

**cp command**
We use the cp command to copy a file in the Linux shell. To copy a folder with its contents recursively use the cp
command with the -r flag.

**mv command**
The mv command is used to rename or move a file or directory 

**tree command**
tree command prints the directory structure in a nice visual tree design way.
 
 **wc command**
 wc, short for word count, is an useful command which can help us to count newlines, words and bytes of a file.

 **echo command**
 echo command echoes any given string to the display

 **man pages**
 man shows the system’s manual pages. This is the command we use to view the help document (manual page) for
any command. The man pages are organized based on sections, and if the same command is found in many different
sections, only the first one is shown.
